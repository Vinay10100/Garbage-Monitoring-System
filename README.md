# Garbage Monitoring System 

The Garbage Monitoring System is a smart waste management solution that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the level of garbage in a bin and indicates it using three levels of LED light. It has a real-time monitoring feature, and when the bin is full, it triggers a buzzer to alert the user. Additionally, it displays the garbage level on an LCD screen.
